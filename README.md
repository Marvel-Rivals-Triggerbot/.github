## 🔫 What’s a Marvel Rivals Triggerbot?

It’s a cheat that **auto-fires** your weapon or ability the instant an enemy enters your crosshair. No clicks, no delays — just pure *reaction time on steroids*. Works best with scoped weapons, one-shots, and precision mains like Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Cloak.

Instead of guessing when to shoot, this bot does the work and pulls the trigger *exactly* when it counts.
